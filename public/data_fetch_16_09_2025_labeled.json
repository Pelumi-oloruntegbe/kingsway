Preparing for the interview     The interview will take approximately 45 minutes where you will be asked a mixture of Behavioural and Strength questions.

The Strength and Behaviour based questioning explores what the candidate can and has done, but also their potential.     Behaviours     You will be assessed against the Civil Service Behaviours listed above at Level 2. An example of a Behavioural question would be “Tell me about a time when you’ve had to deal with a difficult customer.” It may help to use one or more examples of a piece of work you have completed or a situation you have been in and use the WHO or STAR model to explain:           WHO - What it was, How you approached the work/situation and what the Outcomes were, what did you achieve? or      STAR - What was the Situation? What were the Tasks? What Action did you take? What were the Results of your actions?          Strengths     It is difficult to prepare for strength type questions. However, you can think through your answers, focus on your achievements and aspects you enjoy and decide how these can be applied in the organisation and role. While strengths questions are shorter and we do not expect a full STAR response, the panel is interested in your first reaction to the question.     If you do not have work-based examples then please give examples from school/college, clubs, volunteering or other activities you have been involved in. and information or reasoning to support this.

Tell us about a time when you had to make a quick decision in a dynamic or high-pressure situation. What factors did you consider, and what was the result?          Your personal statement needs to set out evidence of how your experience meets the requirements set out above. Your layout is entirely your preference; you may choose narrative, bullets, etc. One narrative example may cover the requirements needed. You don’t have to explain the whole process, just what you have done and the skills and experience you have used. Further details around what this will entail are listed on the application form.     If you do not have work-based examples then please give examples from school/college, clubs, volunteering or other activities you have been involved in.

If so, we will sift on:           Detail a time when you have had a successful outcome by complying with key operating instructions or a complex policy? (Lead question).

In line with our commitment to the Disability Confident Scheme (DCS), we aim to advance all DCS candidates who meet the minimum standard. However, we may only progress those candidates who best meet the required standards.     However, in the event we don’t receive a high number of applications we may not undertake a sift and progress all candidate to the Assessment Centre who successfully completed the test.     Artificial Intelligence can be a useful tool to support your application, however, all examples and statements provided must be truthful, factually accurate and taken directly from your own experience. Where plagiarism has been identified (presenting the ideas and experiences of others, or generated by artificial intelligence, as your own) applications may be withdrawn and internal candidates may be subject to disciplinary action. Please see our candidate guidance for more information on appropriate and inappropriate use.      **Please note the closing date for your full application is 23:55 on 23rd September 2025**     The sift is scheduled to be held from 29th September 2025 to 10th October 2025.

Stage 3 – Assessment Centre     If you pass the written application sift with the required score you will be invited to a Assessment Centre and will receive an electronic notification to your Civil Service Jobs account.     The Assessment Centres will be conducted face to face at one or more of our offices in our North West and Wales region. These may not necessarily be at the locations on this advert.     You will be required to undertake three aptitude assessments at the Assessment Centre.           Observation skills      Listening skills      Map reading skills          The observation and listening skills assessments will utilise both video and audio media that will be played and you will then be required to answer questions on each aspect. The Map reading assessment will be paper-based and again you will be required to answer questions as part of the assessment. Further information will be provided on the day of your assessment.     The Assessment Centres are scheduled to take place week commencing 27th October 2025 to 7th November 2025, please note that this week is only indicative at this stage and could be subject to change. The assessment centres will be scheduled Monday to Friday or on a Saturday, at a time between 09:00 to 17:00. They are expected to last approximately 60 to 90 minutes.     Communications will be electronic and/or by telephone therefore it is vitally important that you check your Civil Service Jobs account regularly, as well as your spam/junk email folder. Telephone calls may show as a withheld number, it is important that you answer so that your assessment can be confirmed.     Stage 4 – Interview     Those who pass the assessment centre with the required scores for each of the three assessments will be invited to a blended interview and will receive an electronic notification to your Civil Service Jobs account.     The interviews where possible will be conducted face to face at our offices stated on slide 2 of the candidate pack, however candidates may be expected to travel to an alternative location as required. If you require any reasonable adjustments to attend a face-to-face interview, please ensure you state those on your application form when asked to do so.     Interviews are scheduled to take place from 24th November 2025 to 5th October 2025, please note that these dates are only indicative at this stage and could be subject to change.

If you would like to opt out of SMS messages, please email CFCD.RECRUITMENTINBOX@DWP.GOV.UK     As part of our commitment to improving the candidate experience, you may be contacted during the recruitment process to provide feedback.      Preparing for the interview     The interview will take approximately 45 minutes where you will be asked a mixture of Behavioural and Strength questions. A blended interview aims to be more of a conversation at interview offering a more inclusive approach. The Strength and Behaviour based questioning explores what the candidate can and has done, but also their potential.     Behaviours     You will be assessed against the Civil Service Behaviours listed above at Level 2. An example of a Behavioural question would be “Tell me about a time when you’ve had to deal with a difficult customer.” It may help to use one or more examples of a piece of work you have completed or a situation you have been in and use the WHO or STAR model to explain:           WHO - What it was, How you approached the work/situation and what the Outcomes were, what did you achieve? or      STAR - What was the Situation? What were the Tasks? What Action did you take? What were the Results of your actions?          Strengths     It is difficult to prepare for strength type questions. However, you can think through your answers, focus on your achievements and aspects you enjoy and decide how these can be applied in the organisation and role. While strengths questions are shorter and we do not expect a full STAR response, the panel is interested in your first reaction to the question.     If you do not have work-based examples then please give examples from school/college, clubs, volunteering or other activities you have been involved in. and information or reasoning to support this.      If you withdraw your application at any stage, it will not be progressed any further.      Stage 5 – Offer     Once all interviews have been completed, candidates will be notified of the outcome by email. Offers will be made in strict merit order to the highest scoring candidate first based on your location preferences and the geographical requirements of the business. Dependent on your position on the merit list, if none of your location preferences remain at the point we make a job offer, we may offer you a role at an alternative advertised location. If we are unable to offer you a role in any of your preferred locations, and you are unable to accept a role at an alternative advertised location, we will add you to the reserve list if one is being held.     The successful candidate(s) will be notified of a start date following successful security checks, which is likely to be during January/February 2026.     Please note:            If you are offered the role you applied for, in a location you have expressed a preference for, and you decline the offer or are unable to take up post within a reasonable timeframe you will be withdrawn from the campaign and removed from the reserve list, other than in exceptional circumstances*.

Applicants who are successful at interview will be, as part of pre-employment screening, subject to a check on the Internal Fraud Database (IFD). This check will provide information about employees who have been dismissed for fraud or dishonesty offences. This check also applies to employees who resign or otherwise leave before being dismissed for fraud or dishonesty had their employment continued. Any applicant’s details held on the IFD will be refused employment. A candidate is not eligible to apply for a role within the Civil Service if the application is made within a 5 year period following a dismissal for carrying out internal fraud against government.     If successful and transferring from another Government Department, a criminal record check will be carried out.      Important      New entrants are expected to join on the minimum of the pay band.     Before applying for this vacancy, current employees of DWP should check whether a successful application would result in changes to their terms & conditions of employment, e.g. mobility, pay, allowances. If you are successful you must be able to be released from your current post within 4 weeks.     Those on protected TUPE/ COSoP terms and conditions applying on promotion or voluntary permanent level move will adopt DWP’s Terms and Conditions and this may have a different impact on pay and allowances.

Civil Servants that would transfer into DWP from other government organisations, following successful application, will assume DWP's terms & conditions of employment current on the day they are posted, unless DWP has stated otherwise in writing. Accepting a post will be taken to mean acceptance of revised terms & conditions.     Civil servants applying on promotion will usually be appointed to the salary minimum or within 10% of existing salary.

Examples of plagiarism can include:           Presenting the work, ideas and experience of others as your own      Copying content from an online/published source      Using forms of Artificial Intelligence to produce application content which you present as your own          The same applies to all stages of your application.     Artificial Intelligence can be a useful tool to support your application, however, all examples and statements provided must be truthful, factually accurate and taken directly from your own experience.

Please see our candidate guidance for more information on appropriate and inappropriate use.”      Disclosure and Barring Service and Internal Fraud Database Checks      To process applications without delay, we will be sending a Criminal Record Check to Disclosure and Barring Service or Disclosure Scotland on your behalf. However, we recognise in exceptional circumstances some candidates will want to send their completed forms direct. If you will be doing this, please advise Shared Services Connect Limited of your intention by emailing dwp-customer_hub@resourcing.soprasteria.co.uk stating the job reference number in the subject heading.     Applicants who are successful at interview will be, as part of pre-employment screening, subject to a check on the Internal Fraud Database (IFD). This check will provide information about employees who have been dismissed for fraud or dishonesty offences. This check also applies to employees who resign or otherwise leave before being dismissed for fraud or dishonesty had their employment continued. Any applicant’s details held on the IFD will be refused employment. A candidate is not eligible to apply for a role within the Civil Service if the application is made within a 5 year period following a dismissal for carrying out internal fraud against government.     If successful and transferring from another Government Department, a criminal record check will be carried out.      Important      New entrants are expected to join on the minimum of the pay band.     Before applying for this vacancy, current employees of DWP should check whether a successful application would result in changes to their terms & conditions of employment, e.g. mobility, pay, allowances. If you are successful you must be able to be released from your current post within 4 weeks.     Those on protected TUPE/ COSoP terms and conditions applying on promotion or voluntary permanent level move will adopt DWP’s Terms and Conditions and this may have a different impact on pay and allowances. Please review this prior to acceptance of a role.     Civil Servants that would transfer into DWP from other government organisations, following successful application, will assume DWP's terms & conditions of employment current on the day they are posted, unless DWP has stated otherwise in writing. Accepting a post will be taken to mean acceptance of revised terms & conditions.     Civil servants applying on promotion will usually be appointed to the salary minimum or within 10% of existing salary.

In rapidly-changing times, businesses need to be resilient and ready to face any challenges that are coming their way. They are increasingly having to be more transparent with their reporting, in order to gain trust and confidence with the public. We provide independent Assurance by assessing the risks and processes of an organisation, so that businesses can make sound decisions in this area and serve the public well. Our Assurance team possesses skills and expertise across regulation, reporting, finance, controls, sustainability and AI, with a deep understanding of analytics.       What skills and academic qualifications do I need?      You’ll need to have obtained or be studying towards a minimum 2:1 in any degree discipline and have graduated by September 2026 for the Autumn 2026 intake.             What kind of work will I do?      We’re offering an excellent four-year programme to give you the opportunity to gain insight into assurance, as we develop professionals of the future.      By joining us you’ll have the chance to work directly with major organisations, as well as building your skills through our excellent training programme.

This pillar includes the Accounting, Transactions, Treasury, Financial Services Controls and Regulatory teams.        Controls, Sustainability, and Emerging Assurance (C&SEA): From assessing sustainability data to public scrutiny of reports, the C&SEA pillar is more critical than ever. Teams include Sustainability, Artificial Intelligence and Algorithms, Third Party Assurance, and Client Assets & Safeguarding.

Interviews are scheduled to take place from 03/11/2025 to 14/11/2025, please note that these dates are only indicative at this stage and could be subject to change. Interviews will be scheduled Monday to Friday, between 09:00 to 17:00.     Communications will be electronic, SMS or by telephone therefore it is important that you check your Civil Service Jobs account regularly, as well as your spam/junk email folder. Telephone calls may show as a withheld number, it is important that you answer so that your interview can be confirmed.     If you would like to opt out of SMS messages, please email CFCD.RECRUITMENTINBOX@DWP.GOV.UK     As part of our commitment to improving the candidate experience, you may be contacted during the recruitment process to provide feedback.      Preparing for the Interview      The interview will take between 30 - 40 minutes and will consist of behaviour and strength-based questions.     A blended interview aims to be more of a conversation offering a more inclusive approach. The behaviour and strength-based questioning explores what you, the candidate, can and have done, but also your potential.      Behaviours     You will be assessed against the Civil Service Behaviours listed at level 1.     An example of a behavioural question would be “Tell me about a time when you have had to deal with a difficult customer.”     It may help to use one or more examples of a piece of work you have completed or a situation you have been in and use the WHO or STAR model to explain:           WHO- What it was? How you approached the work/situation? What the Outcomes were, what did you achieve? or      STAR- What was the Situation? What were the Tasks? What Action did you take? What were the Results of your actions?           Strengths     It is difficult to prepare for strength type questions. However, you can think through your answers, focus on your achievements and aspects you enjoy and decide how these can be applied in the organisation and role.     While strengths questions are shorter and we do not expect a full STAR response, the panel is interested in your first reaction to the question and information or reasoning to support this.     If you do not have work-based examples then please give examples from school/college, clubs, volunteering or other activities you have been involved in.      If you withdraw your application at any stage, it will not be progressed any further.      Stage 4 – Offer     Once all interviews have been completed, you will be notified of the outcome by email. Offers will be made in strict merit order to the highest scoring candidate first based on your location preferences and the geographical requirements of the business. Dependent on your position on the merit list, if none of your location preferences remain at the point we make a job offer, we may offer you a role at an alternative advertised location. If we are unable to offer you a role in any of your preferred locations, and you are unable to accept a role at an alternative advertised location, we will add you to the reserve list if one is being held.     The successful candidate(s) will be notified of a start date following successful security checks, which is likely to be during January/February 26.      Please note:           If you are offered the role you applied for, in a location you have expressed a preference for, and you decline the offer or are unable to take up post within a reasonable timeframe you will be withdrawn from the campaign and removed from the reserve list, other than in exceptional circumstances*.      If we make an offer of an alternative role or location to that which you originally applied for, and you decline that offer, you will be able to remain on the reserve list.      Note: exceptional circumstances could be when a candidate has requested a contractual part time working pattern and this pattern cannot be accommodated in the initial role offered, or in cases of serious ill health.

Please be aware that this role can only be worked in the UK and not overseas. Relocation costs will not be reimbursed.      Hybrid working      This job role may be suitable for hybrid working, which is where an employee works part of the week in their DWP office and part of the week from home. This is a voluntary, non-contractual arrangement and your office will be your contractual place of work. The number of days that anyone will be able to work at home will be determined primarily by business need but personal circumstances and other relevant circumstances will also be taken into account.

Hybrid working will not commence until any training and consolidation period has been successfully completed.      Working pattern     Part-time, part-year, term-time compressed hours and job-sharing working patterns within working hours will be considered but must meet business needs. We will do our best to let people with existing part time contracts retain their contracted hours provided they are in line with current business needs.

Currently initial training can last for up to 6 weeks.     Hours of work     The full-time working week in DWP is 37 hours.

Managers will agree working patterns with successful applicants within these business hours and review these as appropriate. You will be given advance notice of your personal schedule.      Further Information     Find out more about Working for DWP     A reserve list may be held for a period of 3 months from which further appointments can be made.

If successful and transferring from another Government Department a criminal record check may be carried out.     In order to process applications without delay, we will be sending a Criminal Record Check to Disclosure and Barring Service/Disclosure Scotland on your behalf.     However, we recognise in exceptional circumstances some candidates will want to send their completed forms direct.

The qualification can be undertaken in work time. You agree to take this job on the basis that you may be required to undertake a work-based qualification; your failure to participate fully in the professional programme, once appointed, may be a breach of your employment contract.     If DWP decides that it is no longer a requirement for you to undertake and attain a work-based qualification, it will release you from this obligation. Any decision to release you from this obligation will not be a breach of contract by DWP.      Important     If you hold a level 3 qualification (2 A levels or equivalent) then please bring your certificates with you to the interview if you have them.

Further Information     Find out more about Working for DWP     A reserve list may be held for a period of 3 months from which further appointments can be made.     Any move to DWP from another employer will mean you can no longer access childcare vouchers. This includes moves between government departments. You may however be eligible for other government schemes, including tax free childcare; for further information visit the Childcare Choices website.     If successful and transferring from another Government Department a criminal record check may be carried out.     In order to process applications without delay, we will be sending a Criminal Record Check to Disclosure and Barring Service/Disclosure Scotland on your behalf.     However, we recognise in exceptional circumstances some candidates will want to send their completed forms direct. If you will be doing this, please advise Government Recruitment Service of your intention by emailing Pre-EmploymentChecks.grs@cabinetoffice.gov.uk stating the job reference number in the subject heading.     For further information on the Disclosure Scotland confidential checking service telephone: the Disclosure Scotland Helpline on 0870 609 6006 and ask to speak to the operations manager in confidence, or email Info@disclosurescotland.co.uk     New entrants are expected to join on the minimum of the pay band.     Applicants who are successful at interview will be, as part of pre-employment screening, subject to a check on the Internal Fraud Database (IFD). This check will provide information about employees who have been dismissed for fraud or dishonesty offences. This check also applies to employees who resign or otherwise leave before being dismissed for fraud or dishonesty had their employment continued. Any applicant’s details held on the IFD will be refused employment.     A candidate is not eligible to apply for a role within the Civil Service if the application is made within a 5-year period following a dismissal for carrying out internal fraud against government.      Learning and Development     DWP takes development seriously. Our aim is for our colleagues in these roles to be appropriately skilled and qualified – as determined by the business. To support this aim you may be required to undertake a work-based qualification, such as an apprenticeship, which will support you in further developing your professional knowledge and skills for this role and your future career development. The qualification can be undertaken in work time. You agree to take this job on the basis that you may be required to undertake a work-based qualification; your failure to participate fully in the professional programme, once appointed, may be a breach of your employment contract.     If DWP decides that it is no longer a requirement for you to undertake and attain a work-based qualification, it will release you from this obligation. Any decision to release you from this obligation will not be a breach of contract by DWP.      Important     If you hold a level 3 qualification (2 A levels or equivalent) then please bring your certificates with you to the interview if you have them.     Before applying for this vacancy, current employees of DWP should check whether a successful application would result in changes to their terms and conditions of employment, for example mobility, pay and allowances. Civil Servants who transfer into DWP from other government organisations, following successful application, will assume DWP's terms and conditions of employment current on the day they are posted, unless DWP has stated otherwise in writing.     The Civil Service values honesty and integrity and expects all candidates to abide by these principles. Please ensure that all examples provided in your application are taken directly from your own experience and that you describe the examples in your own words. Applications will be screened and if evidence of plagiarism or copying examples/answers from other sources is found, your application will be withdrawn. Internal DWP candidates may also face disciplinary action.     The evidence you provide must relate to your own experiences. If evidence of plagiarism, or sharing of questions, information or answers throughout any part of the selection process is found, your application will be withdrawn. Examples of plagiarism can include:           Presenting the work, ideas and experience of others as your own.      Copying content from an online/published source.      Using forms of Artificial Intelligence to produce application content which you present as your own.

If you are successful, any opportunities for hybrid working, including whether a hybrid working arrangement is suitable for you, will be discussed with you prior to you taking up your post. <b>Hybrid working will not commence until any training and consolidation period has been successfully completed.</b></p>\n     <p><b> Working pattern</b></p>\n     <p>Part-time, part-year, term-time compressed hours and job-sharing working patterns within working hours will be considered but must meet business needs. We will do our best to let people with existing part time contracts retain their contracted hours provided they are in line with current business needs. <b>Please note that successful candidates with agreed alternative working patterns will be required to work full time for specific periods to complete all training and consolidation. Currently initial training can last for up to 6 weeks.</b></p>\n     <p><b>Hours of work</b></p>\n     <p>The full-time working week in DWP is 37 hours. You may be required to work at any time between the hours of:</p>\n     <ul>\n      <li>7:45am and 8:00pm on any day between Monday to Friday, and</li>\n      <li>8:45am to 5:00pm on Saturday.</li>\n     </ul>\n     <p>Managers will agree working patterns with successful applicants within these business hours and review these as appropriate. You will be given advance notice of your personal schedule.</p>\n     <p><b> Further Information</b></p>\n     <p>Find out more about Working for DWP</p>\n     <p>A reserve list may be held for a period of 3 months from which further appointments can be made.</p>\n     <p>Any move to DWP from another employer will mean you can no longer access childcare vouchers. This includes moves between government departments. You may however be eligible for other government schemes, including tax free childcare; for further information visit the Childcare Choices website.</p>\n     <p>If successful and transferring from another Government Department a criminal record check may be carried out.</p>\n     <p>In order to process applications without delay, we will be sending a Criminal Record Check to Disclosure and Barring Service/Disclosure Scotland on your behalf.</p>\n     <p>However, we recognise in exceptional circumstances some candidates will want to send their completed forms direct. If you will be doing this, please advise Government Recruitment Service of your intention by emailing Pre-EmploymentChecks.grs@cabinetoffice.gov.uk stating the job reference number in the subject heading.</p>\n     <p>For further information on the Disclosure Scotland confidential checking service telephone: the Disclosure Scotland Helpline on 0870 609 6006 and ask to speak to the operations manager in confidence, or email Info@disclosurescotland.co.uk</p>\n     <p>New entrants are expected to join on the minimum of the pay band.</p>\n     <p>Applicants who are successful at interview will be, as part of pre-employment screening, subject to a check on the Internal Fraud Database (IFD). This check will provide information about employees who have been dismissed for fraud or dishonesty offences. This check also applies to employees who resign or otherwise leave before being dismissed for fraud or dishonesty had their employment continued. Any applicant&#x2019;s details held on the IFD will be refused employment.</p>\n     <p>A candidate is not eligible to apply for a role within the Civil Service if the application is made within a 5-year period following a dismissal for carrying out internal fraud against government.</p>\n     <p><b> Learning and Development</b></p>\n     <p>DWP takes development seriously. Our aim is for our colleagues in these roles to be appropriately skilled and qualified &#x2013; as determined by the business. To support this aim you may be required to undertake a work-based qualification, such as an apprenticeship, which will support you in further developing your professional knowledge and skills for this role and your future career development. The qualification can be undertaken in work time. You agree to take this job on the basis that you may be required to undertake a work-based qualification; your failure to participate fully in the professional programme, once appointed, may be a breach of your employment contract.</p>\n     <p>If DWP decides that it is no longer a requirement for you to undertake and attain a work-based qualification, it will release you from this obligation. Any decision to release you from this obligation will not be a breach of contract by DWP.</p>\n     <p><b> Important</b></p>\n     <p>If you hold a level 3 qualification (2 A levels or equivalent) then please bring your certificates with you to the interview if you have them.</p>\n     <p>Before applying for this vacancy, current employees of DWP should check whether a successful application would result in changes to their terms and conditions of employment, for example mobility, pay and allowances. Civil Servants who transfer into DWP from other government organisations, following successful application, will assume DWP&apos;s terms and conditions of employment current on the day they are posted, unless DWP has stated otherwise in writing.</p>\n     <p>The Civil Service values honesty and integrity and expects all candidates to abide by these principles. Please ensure that all examples provided in your application are taken directly from your own experience and that you describe the examples in your own words. Applications will be screened and if evidence of plagiarism or copying examples/answers from other sources is found, your application will be withdrawn. Internal DWP candidates may also face disciplinary action.</p>\n     <p>The evidence you provide must relate to your own experiences. If evidence of plagiarism, or sharing of questions, information or answers throughout any part of the selection process is found, your application will be withdrawn. Examples of plagiarism can include:</p>\n     <ul>\n      <li>Presenting the work, ideas and experience of others as your own.</li>\n      <li>Copying content from an online/published source.</li>\n      <li>Using forms of Artificial Intelligence to produce application content which you present as your own.</li>\n     </ul>\n     <p><b> Reasonable Adjustments</b></p>\n     <p><br> At DWP we value diversity and inclusion and actively encourage and welcome applications from everyone, including those that are underrepresented in our workforce.</p>\n     <p>We consider visible and non-visible disabilities, neurodiversity or learning differences, chronic medical conditions, or mental ill health. Examples include dyslexia, epilepsy, autism, chronic fatigue, or schizophrenia.</p>\n     <p>If you need a change to be made so that you can make your application, you should:</p>\n     <p>Contact Government Recruitment Service via DWPRecruitment.grs@cabinetoffice.gov.uk as soon as possible before the closing date to discuss your needs.</p>\n     <p>Complete the &#x201C;Reasonable Adjustments&#x201D; section in the &#x201C;Additional requirements&#x201D; page of your application form to tell us what changes or help you might need further on in the recruitment process.

    "description_text": "If you're a recent graduate or soon-to-be graduate, join us and unlock a world of carefully curated experiences, knowledge, and connections to shape your career. Along the way, you can expect all the training and support you need to make your mark on the world. Put simply, we’ll empower you to help determine how we do things and where we go next. Our graduates are a vital part of our success, and we welcome applications from people from all walks of life. Whoever you are and wherever you want to join us, if you’re curious, creative, and ambitious, this is a world in which you can truly belong.   Our Explorer Programme  You'll join our explorer programme, a 2-year programme designed to give you depth and breadth of experience. Participating in job-based bespoke training from the start enabling you to go fully-equipped into your role as you embark on the first of three eight-month long rotations.   Why the Cyber & Secruity Graduate programme?   The Chief Security Office is all about keeping the bank, its clients, customers and colleagues safe. We’re here to protect the organisation from both external and internal threats, and every day presents new challenges. This is an exciting place to be: hackers constantly attempt to find new ways to threaten our security, and we never rest in learning new ways to prevent them. And those threats don’t just come from viruses and fraudsters. Our work also touches on issues such as terrorism, world events, and the impact of economic turbulence. As the world around us changes, we have to be prepared and ready to respond. All of which will make your work with us endlessly interesting and deeply significant.   The Cyber & Security teams within our Chief Security Office range from Cyber & Physical Security to Resilience, Crisis Management, Security Operations and Intelligence and more. Everyone is focused on defending the bank. That might mean playing a proactive role, such as researching potential threats from hackers. Or it might mean a reactive role, such as responding to incidents that might challenge our security.
