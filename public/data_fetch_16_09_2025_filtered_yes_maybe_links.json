    "description_text": "Job Introduction \n Job Title: Finance & Procurement Lead A bit about us: Liverpool is home to vibrant, energetic, and engaged communities, people who take real ownership of their local area and are passionate about making our city a better place. We've got ambitious targets to meet by 2025 and we need people who are driven, dynamic and ready to deliver the very best for our communities. Public service is more important than ever, and this role represents a real opportunity to make a difference to our communities by transforming the way we work and placing our residents at the heart of everything we do. Working at Liverpool City Council provides an opportunity to contribute to your community and make a positive impact on the lives of residents. Our values shape how we work to deliver public services, and how we communicate with the residents we serve. We care about the best outcomes for local people, through our public services. We are proud of our world-famous thriving city with its rich culture, as well as affordable housing, good schools, beautiful green spaces – there’s really something for everyone! The role: As part of our transformation journey, Liverpool City Council is implementing an integrated Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system that will transform our Finance, Human Resources, and Payroll functions. The new ERP system will replace our current SAP (Finance) and Oracle (Payroll) platforms, along with several smaller systems covering other functions within Finance and Resources and HR and Payroll. It will be built using Microsoft Dynamics for Finance and Resources, and MHR i-Trent for HR and Payroll. We are looking to stand up a team of experts to work in partnership with Ernst and Young (EY), who have been appointed to deliver the integrated solution, and internal subject matter experts to help shape the future of how we work, ensuring we deliver the best outcomes for staff and residents. The Finance and Procurement Lead owns the design of the replacement finance system and associated processes for the Finance and Procurement directorate. The postholder will work with and guide the Council design leads and service functions through the implementation of the new system. This involves integrating best practices from the finance and procurement sectors, incorporating feedback from stakeholders, and applying programmatic knowledge to ensure a smooth and successful transition. The role requires a strategic approach to align the system's design with organisational goals, optimize workflows, and facilitate effective change management throughout the implementation process. The role will be working as part of the Core Business Programme Team responsible for achieving transformation of the Council’s core business functions (i.e., Finance, Procurement, HR/OD, and Payroll) including the design and implementation of new integrated cloud technology.
