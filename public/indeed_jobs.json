Owkin is a great place to work. As a coveted workplace we are, unfortunately, vulnerable to recruitment phishing scams. We urge all job seekers and candidates to be wary of potential scams. Most of these have individuals posing as representatives of prominent companies, including Owkin, with the aim of obtaining personal, sensitive, or financial information from applicants. These scams prey upon an individual's desire to obtain a job and can sometimes \"feel\" like a genuine recruitment process. Some red flags are identified below. Should you encounter a recruitment process that claims to be for Owkin but is not consistent with the below, please do not provide any personal or financial information:   Legitimate Owkin recruitment processes include communication with candidates through recognized professional networks, such as LinkedIn.   Communication is always through an official Owkin email address (from the @owkin.com domain), over the phone or through our applicant tracking system (Greenhouse).   The Owkin talent team do use platforms such as LinkedIn and Job Teaser, however if you have any concern or doubt about this contact, please ask for them to send an email from @Owkin.com.   The Owkin talent team will not solicit personal data from candidates during the application phase including, but not limited to, date of birth, social security numbers, or bank account information;   Legitimate Owkin interviews may be conducted over the phone, in person, or via an approved enterprise videoconferencing service (Google Meets). They will not occur via Signal, Telegram or Messenger   Owkin offers of employment are based on merit and only extended once a candidate has interviewed with members of the talent and hiring team. Offers will be extended both verbally and in written format.      If you think that you have been a victim of fraud,     Check the identity of the talent team on LinkedIn.

Today, we partner with over 180 team members around the world. Our diverse team hails from 42 nationalities, with backgrounds ranging from self-taught DeFi natives to PhDs. Predominantly remote, we have hubs in London, Brussels, and Singapore, and host regular online and offline hangouts to keep the crew tight.  We are trading on more than 80 exchanges, and working with a wide array of asset issuers. As a well-established market maker, our distinctive expertise led us to expand rapidly. Today, our services span market making, options trading, high-frequency trading, OTC, and DeFi trading desks.  But we’re more than a service provider. We’re an initiator. We're pioneers in adopting the Rust Development language for our algorithmic trading, and champions of its use in the industry. We support the growth of Web3 startups through our Accelerator Program. We upgrade ecosystems by injecting liquidity into promising DeFi, RWA, and NFT protocols. And we push the industry's progress with our research and governance initiatives.  At Keyrock, we're not just envisioning the future of digital assets. We're actively building it.   Mission statement We are seeking a highly technical, hands-on Technical Product Manager to join our team and act as the internal, central hub for core services and automation that support trading business units at Keyrock. This is a role for a builder at heart—someone who can not only identify opportunities but also rapidly prototype solutions. You will be pivotal in assessing technical solutions (buy vs build), connecting APIs, building proofs of concept, and driving the integration of cutting-edge technology to solve critical business challenges. Working in close coordination with the VP of Product, and in support of the COO office and VP of Engineering, you will bridge the gap between idea and implementation with a focus on the non-trading teams of Keyrock. Your primary responsibility is to assess outcomes and value (prioritisation) and translate complex needs into tangible, working prototypes, demonstrating value and technical feasibility firsthand, in alignment with the VP Engineering and software development practices at Keyrock. A strong background in software development is therefore essential for this role. You will support critical visibility and communication at the centre of Keyrock, paving the way for our engineering teams to build and scale the proven solutions you have discovered and proven.  Keyrock Product Managers are responsible for developing valuable and viable systems (& implicit services) that consider the voices of   Business & Commercial teams,  Trading & Research teams,  And Engineering builders.   In this way, a level of ‘trilingual’ competency is required for the role.   Outcomes    Strategy, Roadmap, & Technical alignment: You will turn the goals of central technology teams into a clear roadmap. You'll run regular meetings with these teams, together with leaders from product, engineering, and architecture to find problems early, understand how projects depend on each other, and spot chances to improve how we work together.   Technology Assessment & Prioritisation: You will help us make smart technology choices. You'll figure out what our teams need, decide whether it's better to build our own solution or buy one, and use clear data to balance what's valuable for the business against how hard it is to build.   Technical Solution discovery, design & prototyping: You will quickly build working models to test out new ideas. You'll be hands-on, creating functional prototypes to see if a concept is worth pursuing before we invest heavily in it.   Stakeholder Communication & Central Operations: You will be the initial product & tech contact for our business operations and back-office teams. You'll explain our technology plans in simple terms to everyone, ensuring we're all on the same page, and help our central Platform team explore new product ideas.   Engineering Collaboration & Systems Integration: When needed, you will design and build the first versions of new solutions to see how they fit into our existing systems, following guidance from our senior engineering and product leaders. You'll set a clear example for how to move from a defined idea to a developed, performant, secure, product, for other teams to follow.   Technical Research & Experimentation: You will actively test new and emerging technologies to see if they're actually useful for us. When our tech leaders have an idea, you'll go beyond basic research by getting your hands dirty, setting up new tools, and finding out their real-world value for Keyrock.   Reporting Performance & Impact Measurement: You will measure the success of our new ideas and products. You'll create simple metrics to track their impact, use data and feedback to make improvements, and work with our data visualization team to present the results clearly, helping us manage risks before they become problems.   Process Optimisation & FinOps: You will find ways to make our operations run more smoothly and cost-effectively. You'll review our current processes to see where we can improve and help the company adopt best practices for managing and reducing our cloud spending.    Essentials    Proven Development Background: 5+ years of experience in a tech operations, software development, or data engineering role is required. You must have a strong portfolio and be comfortable writing code, building data pipelines, and integrating systems.

Today, we partner with over 180 team members around the world. Our diverse team hails from 42 nationalities, with backgrounds ranging from self-taught DeFi natives to PhDs. Predominantly remote, we have hubs in London, Brussels, and Singapore, and host regular online and offline hangouts to keep the crew tight.  We are trading on more than 80 exchanges, and working with a wide array of asset issuers. As a well-established market maker, our distinctive expertise led us to expand rapidly. Today, our services span market making, options trading, high-frequency trading, OTC, and DeFi trading desks.  But we’re more than a service provider. We’re an initiator. We're pioneers in adopting the Rust Development language for our algorithmic trading, and champions of its use in the industry. We support the growth of Web3 startups through our Accelerator Program. We upgrade ecosystems by injecting liquidity into promising DeFi, RWA, and NFT protocols. And we push the industry's progress with our research and governance initiatives.  At Keyrock, we're not just envisioning the future of digital assets. We're actively building it.   Mission statement We are seeking a highly technical, hands-on Technical Product Manager to join our team and act as the internal, central hub for core services and automation that support trading business units at Keyrock. This is a role for a builder at heart—someone who can not only identify opportunities but also rapidly prototype solutions. You will be pivotal in assessing technical solutions (buy vs build), connecting APIs, building proofs of concept, and driving the integration of cutting-edge technology to solve critical business challenges. Working in close coordination with the VP of Product, and in support of the COO office and VP of Engineering, you will bridge the gap between idea and implementation with a focus on the non-trading teams of Keyrock. Your primary responsibility is to assess outcomes and value (prioritisation) and translate complex needs into tangible, working prototypes, demonstrating value and technical feasibility firsthand, in alignment with the VP Engineering and software development practices at Keyrock. A strong background in software development is therefore essential for this role. You will support critical visibility and communication at the centre of Keyrock, paving the way for our engineering teams to build and scale the proven solutions you have discovered and proven.  Keyrock Product Managers are responsible for developing valuable and viable systems (& implicit services) that consider the voices of   Business & Commercial teams,  Trading & Research teams,  And Engineering builders.   In this way, a level of ‘trilingual’ competency is required for the role.   Outcomes    Strategy, Roadmap, & Technical alignment: You will turn the goals of central technology teams into a clear roadmap. You'll run regular meetings with these teams, together with leaders from product, engineering, and architecture to find problems early, understand how projects depend on each other, and spot chances to improve how we work together.   Technology Assessment & Prioritisation: You will help us make smart technology choices. You'll figure out what our teams need, decide whether it's better to build our own solution or buy one, and use clear data to balance what's valuable for the business against how hard it is to build.   Technical Solution discovery, design & prototyping: You will quickly build working models to test out new ideas. You'll be hands-on, creating functional prototypes to see if a concept is worth pursuing before we invest heavily in it.   Stakeholder Communication & Central Operations: You will be the initial product & tech contact for our business operations and back-office teams. You'll explain our technology plans in simple terms to everyone, ensuring we're all on the same page, and help our central Platform team explore new product ideas.   Engineering Collaboration & Systems Integration: When needed, you will design and build the first versions of new solutions to see how they fit into our existing systems, following guidance from our senior engineering and product leaders. You'll set a clear example for how to move from a defined idea to a developed, performant, secure, product, for other teams to follow.   Technical Research & Experimentation: You will actively test new and emerging technologies to see if they're actually useful for us. When our tech leaders have an idea, you'll go beyond basic research by getting your hands dirty, setting up new tools, and finding out their real-world value for Keyrock.   Reporting Performance & Impact Measurement: You will measure the success of our new ideas and products. You'll create simple metrics to track their impact, use data and feedback to make improvements, and work with our data visualization team to present the results clearly, helping us manage risks before they become problems.   Process Optimisation & FinOps: You will find ways to make our operations run more smoothly and cost-effectively. You'll review our current processes to see where we can improve and help the company adopt best practices for managing and reducing our cloud spending.    Essentials    Proven Development Background: 5+ years of experience in a tech operations, software development, or data engineering role is required. You must have a strong portfolio and be comfortable writing code, building data pipelines, and integrating systems.   Technical Product Management Experience: A demonstrated track record of transitioning from a purely technical role to one with product ownership responsibilities, successfully launching and iterating on technical products.
