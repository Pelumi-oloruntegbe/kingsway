Salary Range: £30,000 - £38,000  Role Type: Full-Time, Permanent  Start date: As soon as possible  Visa / Sponsorship Available: Not Available   The Finance Assistant Role As we continue to scale at pace and expand globally, we're looking for a Finance Assistant to join our growing Finance team at Send. This role is a fantastic opportunity for someone early in their finance career who wants to gain hands-on experience within a fast-moving SaaS business. You'll play a key role in supporting the day-to-day financial operations of the company, ensuring accuracy across transactions, invoices, and reporting. Working closely with our Finance Manager and CFO, you'll get exposure to all aspects of finance in a high-growth tech environment-from accounts payable and receivable to month-end processes-while helping us maintain robust financial controls as we scale. This is an ideal role for someone who is proactive, detail-oriented, and eager to develop their skills within a supportive, collaborative team. At Send, you'll have the chance to learn quickly, take ownership, and make a real impact as we continue our mission to be the market-leading underwriting software platform for agile insurers.   About Send In 2017, Send was founded by Andy Moss, Ben Huckel, and Matt McGrillis with a vision to reshape and enhance the underwriting process for commercial insurers-combining advanced technology with deep industry expertise. By 2019, we had delivered a commercial and specialty Underwriting Workbench for a leading global insurer-one of the UK's top five composite insurers and a major FTSE 100 carrier. This solution streamlined operations, improved efficiency, and enabled forward visibility. In 2022, we won three industry awards for the Underwriting Workbench and raised $10 million in Series A funding to support our expansion in the UK and US. The following year, in 2023, we launched Smart Submission, a stand-alone component of the Underwriting Workbench, and were named a Leader in the IDC MarketScape: Worldwide P&C Intelligent Underwriting Workbench Applications Vendor Assessment. In 2024, we were recognised as a Top Provider in the Datos P&C Workbench report and named a Leader in Celent's Underwriting Workbench reports for both North America and Global Markets. Our vision is to be the market-leading underwriting software platform for agile carriers. #loveunderwriting   Our Funding From 2017 to 2022, we bootstrapped our growth journey, building a profitable and stable company. In November 2022, following a year of strong customer and team growth, we secured $10 million in Series A funding to accelerate our expansion across the UK and US, as well as to further enhance our product development. We're proud to have the support and expertise of our investors, Mercia and Breega. We are now preparing for our Series B round and are excited about the growth acceleration this will enable.   The Send Team Over the past two years, Send has experienced significant growth, expanding our team by over 50% to more than 90 people. At the start of 2024, our team was primarily based in the UK and Poland. Since then, we've taken major steps toward building a global presence, with team members now located across the US, India, and Ireland-all working collaboratively toward our vision of becoming the market-leading underwriting software platform for agile insurers.

Salary Range: £30,000 - £38,000  Role Type: Full-Time, Permanent  Start date: As soon as possible  Visa / Sponsorship Available: Not Available   The Finance Assistant Role As we continue to scale at pace and expand globally, we're looking for a Finance Assistant to join our growing Finance team at Send. This role is a fantastic opportunity for someone early in their finance career who wants to gain hands-on experience within a fast-moving SaaS business. You'll play a key role in supporting the day-to-day financial operations of the company, ensuring accuracy across transactions, invoices, and reporting. Working closely with our Finance Manager and CFO, you'll get exposure to all aspects of finance in a high-growth tech environment-from accounts payable and receivable to month-end processes-while helping us maintain robust financial controls as we scale. This is an ideal role for someone who is proactive, detail-oriented, and eager to develop their skills within a supportive, collaborative team. At Send, you'll have the chance to learn quickly, take ownership, and make a real impact as we continue our mission to be the market-leading underwriting software platform for agile insurers.   About Send In 2017, Send was founded by Andy Moss, Ben Huckel, and Matt McGrillis with a vision to reshape and enhance the underwriting process for commercial insurers-combining advanced technology with deep industry expertise. By 2019, we had delivered a commercial and specialty Underwriting Workbench for a leading global insurer-one of the UK's top five composite insurers and a major FTSE 100 carrier. This solution streamlined operations, improved efficiency, and enabled forward visibility. In 2022, we won three industry awards for the Underwriting Workbench and raised $10 million in Series A funding to support our expansion in the UK and US. The following year, in 2023, we launched Smart Submission, a stand-alone component of the Underwriting Workbench, and were named a Leader in the IDC MarketScape: Worldwide P&C Intelligent Underwriting Workbench Applications Vendor Assessment. In 2024, we were recognised as a Top Provider in the Datos P&C Workbench report and named a Leader in Celent's Underwriting Workbench reports for both North America and Global Markets. Our vision is to be the market-leading underwriting software platform for agile carriers. #loveunderwriting   Our Funding From 2017 to 2022, we bootstrapped our growth journey, building a profitable and stable company. In November 2022, following a year of strong customer and team growth, we secured $10 million in Series A funding to accelerate our expansion across the UK and US, as well as to further enhance our product development. We're proud to have the support and expertise of our investors, Mercia and Breega. We are now preparing for our Series B round and are excited about the growth acceleration this will enable.

In rapidly-changing times, businesses need to be resilient and ready to face any challenges that are coming their way. They are increasingly having to be more transparent with their reporting, in order to gain trust and confidence with the public. We provide independent Assurance by assessing the risks and processes of an organisation, so that businesses can make sound decisions in this area and serve the public well. Our Assurance team possesses skills and expertise across regulation, reporting, finance, controls, sustainability and AI, with a deep understanding of analytics.       What skills and academic qualifications do I need?      You’ll need to have obtained or be studying towards a minimum 2:1 in any degree discipline and have graduated by September 2026 for the Autumn 2026 intake.             What kind of work will I do?      We’re offering an excellent four-year programme to give you the opportunity to gain insight into assurance, as we develop professionals of the future.      By joining us you’ll have the chance to work directly with major organisations, as well as building your skills through our excellent training programme. From providing support to small businesses right through to global corporations, the work we do is wide-ranging and no two days are ever the same.            During the programme you will have the opportunity to work in one, or both, of the following Assurance pillars:                    Accounting & Reporting Assurance: The importance of high reporting standards has never been greater. We provide assurance and solutions to meet these increasing demands, as well as emerging business and regulatory needs. This pillar includes the Accounting, Transactions, Treasury, Financial Services Controls and Regulatory teams.        Controls, Sustainability, and Emerging Assurance (C&SEA): From assessing sustainability data to public scrutiny of reports, the C&SEA pillar is more critical than ever. Teams include Sustainability, Artificial Intelligence and Algorithms, Third Party Assurance, and Client Assets & Safeguarding.                   On successful completion of the programme, you’ll secure a permanent position within one of these Assurance teams.\n                          Where will I work?       At Deloitte we recognise how important face-to-face interaction is for your development in a new role. We also understand that our people need flexibility, which is why we operate a hybrid system, with a combination of office and home working. If you’re in a client-facing role, you might be expected to attend client sites on certain days, while your meetings will be a mix of online and in-person events.       Please note your final assessment and induction will also be in-person, to give you the opportunity to network and build relationships.        All our workspaces are accessible, however, if you require further flexibility due to a health condition or caring responsibilities, please discuss this with our team. You can find further information on our parent and carer policies here.                                  What’s in it for me?            You will be joining a world-class Graduate training scheme at Deloitte, in a full-time permanent role that gives you a market-leading salary, benefits, and endless opportunities.

In rapidly-changing times, businesses need to be resilient and ready to face any challenges that are coming their way. They are increasingly having to be more transparent with their reporting, in order to gain trust and confidence with the public. We provide independent Assurance by assessing the risks and processes of an organisation, so that businesses can make sound decisions in this area and serve the public well. Our Assurance team possesses skills and expertise across regulation, reporting, finance, controls, sustainability and AI, with a deep understanding of analytics.       What skills and academic qualifications do I need?      You’ll need to have obtained or be studying towards a minimum 2:1 in any degree discipline and have graduated by September 2026 for the Autumn 2026 intake.             What kind of work will I do?      We’re offering an excellent four-year programme to give you the opportunity to gain insight into assurance, as we develop professionals of the future.      By joining us you’ll have the chance to work directly with major organisations, as well as building your skills through our excellent training programme. From providing support to small businesses right through to global corporations, the work we do is wide-ranging and no two days are ever the same.            During the programme you will have the opportunity to work in one, or both, of the following Assurance pillars:                    Accounting & Reporting Assurance: The importance of high reporting standards has never been greater. We provide assurance and solutions to meet these increasing demands, as well as emerging business and regulatory needs. This pillar includes the Accounting, Transactions, Treasury, Financial Services Controls and Regulatory teams.        Controls, Sustainability, and Emerging Assurance (C&SEA): From assessing sustainability data to public scrutiny of reports, the C&SEA pillar is more critical than ever. Teams include Sustainability, Artificial Intelligence and Algorithms, Third Party Assurance, and Client Assets & Safeguarding.
